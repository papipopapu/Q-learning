# Q-learning
Learning the basics of reinforcement learning. 
The agent learned to play connect three through the Bellman equation and whatnot perfectly.
Basics learned ---> more complicated shit in the future. 


## In the future:
- Connect three has a small state space, we I don't mind wasting space in the Qtable with improbable/impossible states.
  For future games, dynamically expand the Q table with maps for example (to generalize).
- Add self-play in the training process.
- Try other learning techniques, maybe even dip my toes into DQN (hopefully building things myself).
- Whatever and whatnot and etcetera and ...
